#### [[Luke]] 1
#####
> Fear came on all those who lived around them, and all these things were being talked about throughout the hill country of Judea. All who heard about him took it to heart, saying "What then will this child become?" For, indeed, the Lord's hand was with him.
##### John's circumstances of birth were not hidden in a corner. I've thought in the past that John seems to come out of nowhere as a crazy prophet in the wilderness for most folk. However, Luke tells the tale of one that people were expecting to do something big. People were talking about him at his birth. There was clear evidence from the circumstances that surrounded it, and they were known, not just recorded in Scripture or us later.
##### But even with John, the focus of Zechariah's prophecy over John is on the Christ who has, at that point, already come.
